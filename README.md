### 🌱 About Me

I'm a passionate frontend developer dedicated to crafting clean, maintainable, and pixel-perfect user interfaces. With several years of experience in building products at scale, I love transforming ideas into beautiful and performant digital solutions. My focus is on delivering seamless user experiences, balancing aesthetics with functionality, and always pushing for best practices in modern web development.

Currently living in **Berlin & İzmir/Çeşme**.

Outside of coding, you’ll find me building with LEGO bricks—because creativity goes beyond the code! I believe in continuous learning, sharing knowledge, and being part of a community that thrives on innovation and collaboration.
